  "about": {
    "title1": "Why",
    "text1": "We want to inform society on the diverse experiences belonging to young people of colour, humanizing them and challenging the narrative that makes them one-dimensional. We want to build a picture of how they are affected by race, identity and culture, making young people of colour everyday citizens in society’s eyes.",
    "title2": "Who",
    "text2": "Kids of Colour is led by Roxy Legane, who has worked in the youth and charity sector since 2013. She set up Kids of Colour in February 2018, tired of society’s ways of representing young people of colour homogenously; rarely sharing their individual experiences, interests or views."

      "text": "Kids of Colour really gave me a platform to share my views of race and also helped me to have a deeper understanding of who I am, and where I come from.",

    {
      "text": "Taking part in the Kids of Colour project has allowed me to feel that my voice and my experiences being a young person of colour within society are valid; that I am entitled to speak up against injustices I may face, and that I am being heard. It has been a privilege to be part of it, and I really hope it is recognised for the impact it has had on the young people who have participated.",
